## Future

### As a Course

The idea would be to develop minimal tooling similar to Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning and then advance through key concepts levering this tooling as a learning aid.

Coverage would be of topics such as Orders and Lattices, we would bootstrap understanding the algorithms by applying them to the concepts needed for understanding their meta-proofs.

Model checking through enumeration and fuzzing versus constraints.
